// Write a C program to generate prime numbers which has two equidistant prime numbers from it within a given range.

// For example, 5 is one such number because we have two prime numbers 3 and 7 both of which are equidistant from 5. The distance in this case would be 2.

// Can you generate all such numbers in ascending order within a given range along with their corresponding two prime numbers and distance?

// Sample Input/Output
//     Input:
//     2 10
//     Output
//     3 5 7 2

//     Input
//     10 30
//     Output
//     11 17 23 6                                                                                                                                                     
//     17 23 29 6
